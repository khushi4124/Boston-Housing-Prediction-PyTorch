**# Boston-Housing-Prediction-PyTorch**
This neural network predicts Boston house prices by using a hidden layer to learn complex, non-linear patterns in the data. The model uses data cleaning and feature scaling, ensuring the math remains stable. By using a Dropout layer to prevent the model from simply memorizing the training set, it is able to generalize the data.
